# Wireless Access Point (WAP)


### RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)
### dBm is decibel-milliwatts
at 0 dBm - unrealisticly ideal situation (you are on the Moon)
from -20 dBm to -30 dBm (too loud)
from -40 dBm to -50 dBm (this is OK)
from -60 dBm to -70 dBm (no so great)
from -80 dBm to -100 dBm (dead)


### SNR (Signal To Noise Ratio)


### The two frequencies that we care about
- 2.4 GHz (not excellent, has very few non-overlapping frequencies)
- 5 GHz (much better, has many non-overlapping frequencies)


### Basic Service Area (BSA)
- area of one WAP

### Basic Service Set (BSS)
- tech characteristics of one WAP

### Extended Service Set (ESS)
- tech characteristics of many connected WAPs

### Service Set Identifier (SSID) (not unique name)
- not unique name of many connected WAPs

### Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) (unique name)
- unique name of one WAP

### Distribution Network (i.e. which switch the WAP is connected to)
(and Mesh networks -> WAP1 to WAP2 to WAP3, no cable and no switch are used)

### Roaming
- connecting from WAP1 to WAP2 as the user moves
